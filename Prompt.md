Research and build a git Tiny Tutorial™.
Make it so that a beginner can be brought up-to-speed with common git operations.
Use Markdown files to store the tutorials and create a frontend in html,js,css for them with micro-animations, problems and quizzes. Make a sticky progress bar (be careful with this to make sure it works properly.)
